I am fifty years old and just started to learn coding for the first time. 
Would I be able to open my brain stil?

## Main problems are:

- hardly can *concentrate*,my head is already full of rubish 
- can't swimm in the ocean of *terminologies* of the computer science
- **back aches**, **neck aches** and **head aches** caused by too long working
 
## Should these things help:

1. Determination
2. Hardworking
3. Enjoy learning
